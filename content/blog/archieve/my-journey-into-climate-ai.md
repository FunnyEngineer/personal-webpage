# My Journey into Climate AI Research

Looking back at my path to becoming a PhD student studying machine learning and climate science at UT Austin, I'm reminded that career journeys are rarely linear. Here's my story and some lessons I've learned.

## The Beginning

I started my career in software engineering, building web applications and working with data pipelines. While the work was intellectually stimulating, I felt something was missing—a deeper sense of purpose and connection to real-world impact.

## The Turning Point

Climate change news became increasingly urgent, and I found myself thinking: "What can I do with my technical skills?" That question led me to explore the intersection of:

- **Data science** (my strength)
- **Climate science** (my growing interest)
- **Energy systems** (practical application)

## Making the Leap

Transitioning to research wasn't easy. I had to:

### 1. Fill Knowledge Gaps
I took online courses in:
- Atmospheric physics
- Energy systems modeling
- Advanced statistics and ML

### 2. Build a Portfolio
I contributed to open-source climate data projects and published blog posts about my learning journey.

### 3. Network
I attended conferences (AGU, NeurIPS workshops), reached out to researchers, and joined online communities.

### 4. Take the Risk
Leaving a stable job for a PhD program was scary, but the potential for meaningful impact made it worthwhile.

## What I'm Learning

### Research is Different from Industry

**Industry**: Clear objectives, fast iteration, working products  
**Research**: Ambiguous problems, slow progress, lots of dead ends

But both are rewarding in their own ways!

### Interdisciplinary Work is Hard

Combining ML and climate science means:
- Learning two different vocabularies
- Bridging different methodologies
- Convincing both communities your work matters

### Imposter Syndrome is Real

Everyone in grad school feels it. The key is finding supportive mentors and peers.

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on:

1. **Urban Heat Island Prediction**: Using satellite imagery and ML to predict extreme heat in cities
2. **Building Energy Optimization**: Reinforcement learning for HVAC control
3. **Climate Downscaling**: Super-resolution techniques for climate model outputs

## Advice for Others

If you're considering a similar transition:

### Start Small
You don't need to commit to a PhD immediately. Try:
- Online courses
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Attending virtual seminars
- Reading papers in the field

### Find Your Niche
Climate + AI is broad. What specific problems excite you?
- Agriculture?
- Renewable energy?
- Extreme weather?
- Urban systems?

### Build Connections
The climate AI community is welcoming and collaborative. Don't hesitate to reach out to researchers whose work you admire.

### Be Patient
It takes time to develop expertise in a new field. Celebrate small wins along the way.

## Looking Forward

I'm excited about the future of climate AI. The field is growing rapidly, with opportunities in:
- Academia
- National labs
- Climate tech startups
- NGOs and think tanks

The climate crisis needs diverse skills and perspectives. Whether you're an engineer, designer, policy expert, or scientist, there's a place for you in this fight.
